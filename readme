This is my second project.

To do:

1. Using the jQuery library
2. Interact with the HTML using events (such as a click)
3. Take input from the user
4. Update and edit HTML with jQuery
5. Nice looking HTML + CSS to go along with the jQuery
6. Have some sort of computed logic in it

Here's the project.

The user clicks on the type of cat they own.

The logic then suggests different books throughout history that the cat might enjoy.

If the book is .... then .... (for some computed logic)
